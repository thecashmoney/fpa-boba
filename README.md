This project uses HTML with CSS animations controlled by scrolling on JS. As the user scrolls through the pre-requisites for the workshop, boba is slowly added on and the user sees a completed drink at the end! The website also shows the sticker handed out at the workshop. Majority of the time spent on this project was spent on animations and scroll behavior. I created this website instead of using the original hack club boba website to practice my skills with web dev, learn more about animations, and create a place where I can easily put in the date and time of the workshop as well as the interest form.
